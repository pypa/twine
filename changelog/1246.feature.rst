Automatically refresh short-lived PyPI token in long running Trusted Publishing
uploads.

In the event that a trusted publishing upload job is taking longer than the
validity period of a trusted publishing token (15 minutes at the time of this
writing), *and* we are already 10 minutes into that validity period, we will
begin to attempt to replace the token on each subsequent request.
