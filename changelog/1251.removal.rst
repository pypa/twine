Remove hacks that support ``--skip-existing`` for indexes other than PyPI and
TestPyPI.

To date, these hacks continue to accrue and there have been numerous issues
with them, not the least of which being that every time we update them, the
paid index providers change things to break the compatibility we implement for
them. Beyond that, these hacks do not work when text is internationalized in
the response from the index provider.
