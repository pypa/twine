Fix bug for Repository URLs with auth where the port was lost. When attempting
to prevent printing authentication credentials in URLs provided with username
and password, we did not properly handle the case where the URL also contains
a port (when reconstructing the URL). This is now handled and tested to ensure
no regressions.
