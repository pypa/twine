    * ``https://pypi.python.org/pypi/``
    * ``https://upload.pypi.org/``
    * ``https://upload.pypi.io/``

    This helps people with ``https://upload.pypi.io`` still in their
    :file:`.pypirc` file.

  effort" until 2.0.0

  status code on the response after attempting an upload.
* :support:`-` Do not generate traffic to Legacy PyPI unless we're
  uploading to it or uploading to Warehouse (e.g., pypi.io). This
  avoids the attempt to upload a package to the index if we can find
  it on Legacy PyPI already.
* :release:`1.7.2 <2016-07-05>`
* :bug:`189`, :bug:`191` Fix issue where we were checking the existence of
  packages even if the user didn't specify ``--skip-existing``.

* :bug:`187` Clint was not specified in the wheel metadata as a dependency.
* :release:`1.7.0 <2016-07-04>`
* :feature:`142` Support ``--cert`` and ``--client-cert`` command-line flags

  repositories) with different certificates.

  when raising a redirect exception.
* :release:`1.6.3 <2015-10-05>`
* :bug:`137`, :bug:`140` Uploading signatures was broken due to the pull
  request that added large file support via ``requests-toolbelt``. This
  caused a 500 error on PyPI and prevented package and signature upload in
  twine 1.6.0
* :release:`1.6.2 <2015-09-28>`
* :bug:`132` Upload signatures with packages appropriately

    As part of the refactor for the 1.6.0 release, we were using the wrong
    name to find the signature file.

    This also uncovered a bug where if you're using twine in a situation where
    ``*`` is not expanded by your shell, we might also miss uploading
    signatures to PyPI. Both were fixed as part of this.
