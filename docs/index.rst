Welcome to twine's documentation!
=================================

Twine is `a utility`_ for `publishing`_ Python packages on `PyPI`_.

It provides build system independent uploads of source and binary
`distribution artifacts <distributions_>`_ for both new and existing
`projects`_.

Why Should I Use This?
----------------------

The goal of Twine is to improve PyPI interaction by improving
security and testability.

The biggest reason to use Twine is that it securely authenticates
you to `PyPI`_ over HTTPS using a verified connection, regardless of
the underlying Python version. Meanwhile, ``python setup.py upload``
will only work correctly and securely if your build system, Python
version, and underlying operating system are configured properly.

Secondly, Twine encourages you to build your distribution files. ``python
setup.py upload`` only allows you to upload a package as a final step after
building with ``distutils`` or ``setuptools``, within the same command
invocation. This means that you cannot test the exact file you're going to
upload to PyPI to ensure that it works before uploading it.

Finally, Twine allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the
``.asc`` files into the command line invocation (``twine upload
myproject-1.0.1.tar.gz myproject-1.0.1.tar.gz.asc``). This enables you
to be assured that you're typing your ``gpg`` passphrase into ``gpg``
itself and not anything else, since *you* will be the one directly
executing ``gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>``.

Features
--------

- Verified HTTPS connections
- Uploading doesn't require executing ``setup.py``
- Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing of
  distributions before release
- Supports uploading any packaging format (including `wheels`_)

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install twine

Using Twine
-----------

1. Create some distributions in the normal way:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

2. Upload with ``twine`` to `Test PyPI`_ and verify things look right.
   Twine will automatically prompt for your username and password:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
       username: ...
       password:
       ...

3. Upload to `PyPI`_:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ twine upload dist/*

4. Done!

More documentation on using Twine to upload packages to PyPI is in
the `Python Packaging User Guide`_.

uploading to pypi.org`_.  As such, it is `no longer supported`_ in `Warehouse`_
(the new PyPI software running on pypi.org). However, you may need this if you
are using a different package index.

For completeness, its usage:

.. code-block:: console

    $ twine register -h

    usage: twine register [-h] -r REPOSITORY [--repository-url REPOSITORY_URL]

      --cert path           Path to alternate CA bundle (can also be set via
                            TWINE_CERT environment variable).
      --client-cert path    Path to SSL client certificate, a single file
                            containing the private key and the certificate in PEM
                            format.

Configuration
-------------

Twine can read repository configuration from a ``.pypirc`` file, either in your
home directory, or provided with the ``--config-file`` option. For details on
writing and using ``.pypirc``, see the `specification <pypirc_>`_ in the Python
Packaging User Guide.

Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Twine also supports configuration via environment variables. Options passed on
the command line will take precedence over options set via environment
variables. Definition via environment variable is helpful in environments where
it is not convenient to create a ``.pypirc`` file (for example,
on a CI/build server).

* ``TWINE_USERNAME`` - the username to use for authentication to the
  repository.
* ``TWINE_PASSWORD`` - the password to use for authentication to the
  repository.
* ``TWINE_REPOSITORY`` - the repository configuration, either defined as a
  section in ``.pypirc`` or provided as a full URL.
* ``TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL`` - the repository URL to use.
* ``TWINE_CERT`` - custom CA certificate to use for repositories with
  self-signed or untrusted certificates.
* ``TWINE_NON_INTERACTIVE`` - Do not interactively prompt for username/password
  if the required credentials are missing.

Keyring Support
---------------

Instead of typing in your password every time you upload a distribution, Twine
allows storing a username and password securely using `keyring`_.
Keyring is installed with Twine but for some systems (Linux mainly) may
require `additional installation steps`_.

Once Twine is installed, use the ``keyring`` program to set a
username and password to use for each package index (repository) to
which you may upload.

For example, to set a username and password for PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

    $ keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ your-username

or

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ your-username

and enter the password when prompted.

For a different repository, replace the URL with the relevant repository
URL. For example, for Test PyPI, use ``https://test.pypi.org/legacy/``.

The next time you run ``twine``, it will prompt you for a username and will
grab the appropriate password from the keyring.

**Note:** If you are using Linux in a headless environment (such as on a
server) you'll need to do some additional steps to ensure that Keyring can
store secrets securely. See `Using Keyring on headless systems`_.

Disabling Keyring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most cases, simply not setting a password with ``keyring`` will allow Twine
to fall back to prompting for a password. In some cases, the presence of
Keyring will cause unexpected or undesirable prompts from the backing system.
In these cases, it may be desirable to disable Keyring altogether. To disable
Keyring, simply invoke:

.. code-block:: console

    $ keyring --disable

or

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m keyring --disable

That command will configure for the current user the "null" keyring,
effectively disabling the functionality, and allowing Twine to prompt
for passwords.
