twine
=====

Twine is a utility for interacting with PyPI.

Currently it only supports uploading distributions.


Features
--------

* Verified HTTPS Connections
* Uploading doesn't require executing setup.py
* Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing of
  distributions before release

    $ pip install twine


Usage
-----

1. Create some distributions in the normal way:

.. code:: bash
