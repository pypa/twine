twine
=====

Twine is a utility for interacting `with PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_.

Currently it only supports uploading distributions.


Why Should I Use This?
----------------------

- Uses secure, verified HTTPS connections to upload to PyPI

  By contrast, ``python setup.py upload`` `authenticates you to PyPI 
  over unencrypted, unverfied http <http://bugs.python.org/issue12226>`_. 
  This that means anytime you use ``python setup.py upload``,
  you expose your username and password to being sniffed.
  Twine uses only verified TLS to upload to PyPI,
  protecting your credentials from theft.

- Allows you to precreate your distribution files

  ``python setup.py upload`` only allows you to upload
  something that you've created in the same command invocation.
  This means that you cannot test the exact file
  that you're going to upload to PyPI
  to ensure that it works before uploading it.
  
- Allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the .asc files into the command line invocation
  (e.g.: ``twine upload twine-1.0.1.tar.gz twine-1.0.1.tar.gz.asc``)

  This enables you to be assured that you're typing your gpg passphrase into gpg itself
  and not anything else
  since *you* will be the one directly executing
  ``gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>``.


Features
--------

- Verified HTTPS Connections
- Uploading doesn't require executing setup.py
- Uploading files that have already been created, allowing testing of
  distributions before release
- Supports uploading any packaging format (including wheels).


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install twine


Usage
-----

1. Create some distributions in the normal way:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

2. Upload with twine:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ twine upload dist/*

3. Done!


Options

    usage: twine upload [-h] [-r REPOSITORY] [-s] [-i IDENTITY] [-u USERNAME]
                        [-p PASSWORD] [-c COMMENT]
                        dist [dist ...]

    positional arguments:
      dist                  The distribution files to upload to the repository,
                            may additionally contain a .asc file to include an
                            existing signature with the file upload

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -r REPOSITORY, --repository REPOSITORY
                            The repository to upload the files to
      -s, --sign            Sign files to upload using gpg
      -i IDENTITY, --identity IDENTITY
                            GPG identity used to sign files
      -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                            The username to authenticate to the repository as
      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            The password to authenticate to the repository with
      -c COMMENT, --comment COMMENT

Contributing
------------

1. Fork the `repository <https://github.com/pypa/twine>`_ on GitHub.
2. Make a branch off of master and commit your changes to it.
3. Run the tests with ``tox``

   - Either use ``tox`` to build against all supported Python versions (if you
     have them installed) or use ``tox -e py{version}`` to test against a
     specific version, e.g., ``tox -e py27`` or ``tox -e py34``.
   - Always run ``tox -e pep8``
  
4. Ensure that your name is added to the end of the AUTHORS file using the
   format ``Name <email@domain.com> (url)``, where the ``(url)`` portion is
   optional.
5. Submit a Pull Request to the master branch on GitHub.

If you'd like to have a development environment for twine, you should create a
virtualenv and then do ``pip install -e .`` from within the directory.
